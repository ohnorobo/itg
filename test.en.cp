what is that .
what is the news .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
this is a significant step forward .
i must , nevertheless , make some specific comments .
they will need time for that .
that is surely right .
these are the three characteristics .
we say : ' freedom for iraq !
a free i-raq !
but i wanted to focus on the middle east .
but the resolution as a whole remains ambiguous .
this is why i abstained on this text .
iraq is rich in petroleum .
saddam hussein is a cruel dictator .
it could only make a delicate situation worse .
we want to talk . we want to negotiate .
this time we hope it will involve parliament .
this offers a way forward for the future .
he prefers legal plundering .
and now , bon app?tit !
that concludes the explanations of vote .
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
( the sitting was closed at <num> p.m. )
resumption of the session
- ' enough is enough ' .
? basta ya !
are there any comments ?
subject to that observation , the minutes are approved .
the following change has been proposed :
wednesday :
( parliament agreed to the request )
wonderful !
we can do that , mr leinen .
i hope he will be able to come .
human damage cannot be repaired .
it is impossible to evaluate human suffering .
i do not therefore accept this kind of argument .
this crime can be avoided .
you said that those comments were not correct .
no , i will not do that .
what they put in as a quotation was correct .
no , it is not a point for plenary .
you may take it up with me privately .
' )
that concludes the item .
thank you for coming .
we need both .
this synthesis is difficult and painful .
we are drawing closer together .
we are becoming ever more dependent on each other .
when others are stricken , we are affected .
we need europe to be stronger and more determined .
we have to do our homework for ourselves .
europe has a vital interest in this issue .
human rights must always be nurtured and promoted .
europe can make a difference .
there is no need to shy away from this .
open up your markets ? trade means work .
we must respond .
allow me to address a couple of issues .
trade is important , of course .
i shall cite three examples .
we are part of the imf .
the european union is the best example of this .
there is certainly no way back .
the sea represents life itself .
the theory is now belied by the facts .
i believe that the response could be affirmative .
i shall not dwell on agricultural issues .
commissioner lamy has the floor once again .
the union 's position remains the same .
there must be no misunderstanding on this point .
discussions have begun again .
we must make progress .
that is why we must seek innovative solutions .
this is an incredibly important issue .
neither is an adequate solution .
this is inadequate !
hence the regulation by the council of ministers .
let us welcome your proposal of <num> january .
i wish you very good luck , commissioner .
unilateralism with a reason is just about comprehensible .
unilateralism without any logic whatsoever is unforgivable .
it has still not been solved .
ultimately the political breakthrough came .
that applies to all developing countries and all medicines .
so : this far and no further .
necessity knows no law .
the trips agreements must not be a limiting factor .
then there will be no development round !
that is why we are taking this clear stance .
then new medicines will have to be developed .
that is my first point .
this will undercut the profits of legitimate pharmaceutical industries .
is that something you see as likely , commissioner ?
that was not the intention at doha .
what do we do then ?
this provisional arrangement is simply not enough however .
a long-term solution must therefore be found .
something else enters into this , however .
and this is not always the case .
